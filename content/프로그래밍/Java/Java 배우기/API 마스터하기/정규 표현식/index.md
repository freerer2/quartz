This section teaches the regular expression syntax supported by the `java.util.regex` API and presents several working examples to illustrate how the various objects interact.

  

1. [Introducing Regular Expressions](https://dev.java/learn/regex/intro/)  
    
    Introducing regular expressions: what are they and what you can do with them. Includes the code used to test regular expressions, used throughout this section.
    
2. [String Literals](https://dev.java/learn/regex/string-literals/)  
    
    Introduces basic pattern matching, metacharacters, and quoting.
    
3. [Character Classes](https://dev.java/learn/regex/character-classes/)  
    
    Describes simple character classes, negation, ranges, unions, intersections, and subtraction.
    
4. [Predefined Character Classes](https://dev.java/learn/regex/predefined-character-classes/)  
    
    Describes the basic predefined character classes for whitespace, word, and digit characters.
    
5. [Quantifiers](https://dev.java/learn/regex/quantifiers/)  
    
    Explains greedy, reluctant, and possessive quantifiers for matching a specified expression x number of times.
    
6. [Capturing Groups](https://dev.java/learn/regex/groups/)  
    
    Explains how to treat multiple characters as a single unit.
    
7. [Boundaries](https://dev.java/learn/regex/boundary-matchers/)  
    
    Describes line, word, and input boundaries.
    
8. [The Pattern Class](https://dev.java/learn/regex/patterns/)  
    
    Examines other useful methods of the Pattern class, and explores advanced features such as compiling with flags and using embedded flag expressions.
    
9. [The Matcher Class](https://dev.java/learn/regex/matchers/)  
    
    Describes the commonly-used methods of the Matcher class.
    
10. [Methods of the PatternSyntaxException Class](https://dev.java/learn/regex/pattern-syntax-exception/)  
    
    Describes how to examine a PatternSyntaxException.
