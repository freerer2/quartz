The Stream API is your best tool to process your in-memory data following a map/filter/reduce approach.

The tutorials in this series are listed below. They will guide you all through the Stream API, starting at the basic concepts all the way to collector design and parallel streams.

  

1. [[Processing Data in Memory Using the Stream API]]  
    
    Implementing the map-filter-reduce algorithm
    
2. [[Adding Intermediate Operations on a Stream]]  
    
    Deep-diving into the intermediate operations of the Stream API.
    
3. [[Creating Streams]]  
    
    Patterns to create the stream you need.
    
4. [[Reducing a Stream]]  
    
    Reducing streams with a binary operator.
    
5. [[Adding a Terminal Operation on a Stream]]  
    
    Reducing a stream without the reduce method.
    
6. [[Finding the Characteristics of a Stream]]  
    
    Understanding the characteristics of a stream
    
7. [[Using a Collector as a Terminal Operation]]  
    
    Collecting a stream in a mutable container using a collector.
    
8. [[Creating Your Own Collector]]  
    
    Creating a collector by using the Collectors factory class.
    
9. [[Implementing the Collector Interface]]  
    
    Creating a collector by implementing the Collector interface.
    
10. [[Using Optionals]]  
    
    Introducing the Optional class to model method that cannot produce a value.
    
11. [[Parallelizing Streams]]  
    
    Going faster by leveraging the parallel streams.
